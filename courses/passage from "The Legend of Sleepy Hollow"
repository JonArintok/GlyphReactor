The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions;
stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country,
and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.
The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region,
and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air,
is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head.
It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper,
whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball,
in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War,
and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night,
as if on the wings of the wind.
